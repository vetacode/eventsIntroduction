<!-- The “passive” handler option
The optional passive: true option of addEventListener signals the browser that the handler is not going to call preventDefault().

Why might that be needed?

There are some events like touchmove on mobile devices (when the user moves their finger across the screen), that cause scrolling by default, but that scrolling can be prevented using preventDefault() in the handler.

So when the browser detects such event, it has first to process all handlers, and then if preventDefault is not called anywhere, it can proceed with scrolling. That may cause unnecessary delays and “jitters” in the UI.

The passive: true options tells the browser that the handler is not going to cancel scrolling. Then browser scrolls immediately providing a maximally fluent experience, and the event is handled by the way.

For some browsers (Firefox, Chrome), passive is true by default for touchstart and touchmove events. -->
