<!-- Create Event obj:
let event = new Event(type[, options]);

Arguments:

type – event type, a string like "click" or our own like "my-event".

options – the object with two optional properties:

bubbles: true/false – if true, then the event bubbles.
cancelable: true/false – if true, then the “default action” may be prevented. Later we’ll see what it means for custom events.
By default both are false: {bubbles: false, cancelable: false}. -->

<!-- event.isTrusted
There is a way to tell a “real” user event from a script-generated one.

The property event.isTrusted is true for events that come from real user actions and false for script-generated events. -->
