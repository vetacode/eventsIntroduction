<!-- Syntax:

1. event.stopPropagation(): to make handler decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling.
2. event.stopImmediatePropagation(): To stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running. After it no other handlers execute.

Caveats: Don’t stop bubbling without a need!
Bubbling is convenient. Don’t stop it without a real need. Sometimes event.stopPropagation() creates hidden pitfalls that later may become problems. -->
