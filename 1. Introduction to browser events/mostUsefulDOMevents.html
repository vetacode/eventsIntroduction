<!-- most useful DOM events, just to take a look at:

#Mouse events:
click – when the mouse clicks on an element (touchscreen devices generate it on a tap).
contextmenu – when the mouse right-clicks on an element.
mouseover / mouseout – when the mouse cursor comes over / leaves an element.
mousedown / mouseup – when the mouse button is pressed / released over an element.
mousemove – when the mouse is moved.

#Keyboard events:
keydown and keyup – when a keyboard key is pressed and released.

#Form element events:
submit – when the visitor submits a <form>.
focus – when the visitor focuses on an element, e.g. on an <input>.

#Document events:
DOMContentLoaded – when the HTML is loaded and processed, DOM is fully built.

#CSS events:
transitionend – when a CSS-animation finishes. -->
