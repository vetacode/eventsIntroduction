<!-- The “behavior” pattern
We can also use event delegation to add “behaviors” to elements declaratively, with special attributes and classes.

The pattern has two parts:

We add a custom attribute to an element that describes its behavior.
A document-wide handler tracks events, and if an event happens on an attributed element – performs the action. -->
